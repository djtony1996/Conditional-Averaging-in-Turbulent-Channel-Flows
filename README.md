This repository is for detecting coherent structures related to significant turbulent convection events. 
Turbulent convection -u_i u_j \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} is one term in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation. 
Events with significant values of turbulent convection may play a key role in energy cascade and sustaining turbulence. 
We pick out snapshots experiencing large values of turbulent convection and categorise them according to the sign. 
Then, for both positive and negative events, we plot the vortical coherent structures.
